## Virtualized Intrusion Detection & Prevention System with Threat Intelligence

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on developing a **Security Operations Center as a Service (SOCaaS)** for **Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)** using open-source tools. It integrates **real-time threat intelligence**, **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**, and **centralized security monitoring** to enhance threat detection and incident response.  

## 🔧 Key Features & Implementation  
- ✅ **Proof-of-Concept SOCaaS:** Designed an open-source **Security Operations Center as a Service** to help MSMEs strengthen cybersecurity.  
- ✅ **Lightweight SIEM Deployment:** Installed and configured **Wazuh on Raspberry Pi 4** for real-time log analysis and threat monitoring.  
- ✅ **Real-World Testbed:** Built a **network simulation environment** with a monitored switch, **three virtual machines**, and **two physical machines** across multiple subnets.  
- ✅ **Hybrid IDPS:** Integrated **signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques** for proactive threat identification.  
- ✅ **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Incorporated **real-time threat feeds** to improve detection and response.  
- ✅ **Centralized Log Management:** Deployed a **distributed SIEM** for security event correlation, log analysis, and automated alerting.  

## 📖 Learning & Takeaways  
- 🔹 Hands-on experience in **network security architecture, threat intelligence, and security monitoring**.  
- 🔹 Expertise in **Wazuh, Suricata, SIEM, and intrusion detection systems**.  
- 🔹 Strengthened skills in **network segmentation, security automation, and log correlation**.
